# Installation

Use `akashic` command provided by [akashic-cli (ja)][cli] at the game directory root (which includes game.json):

```
akashic install @xnv/akashic-scrollable
```

or plain `npm`:

```
npm i --save -E @xnv/akashic-scrollable
npm shrinkwrap
```

Recommended to shrinkwrap. (`akashic` automatically does.)

If you are using the TypeScript template generated by `akashic init -t typescript`,
you also need to install the library at the project root.

```
npm install -DE @xnv/akashic-scrollable
```

This is because the TypeScript template requires the library both compile-time (.d.ts) and run-time (.js).
